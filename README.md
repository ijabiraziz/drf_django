# drf_django
I have created api using djangorestframework.


- First install djangorestframework using pip 1.e,
- pip install djangorestframework
- Next step is to add 'rest_framework' inside installed_app(go to setting.py of the main project)
- I have preferred to use function-based views rather than class-based views.



FUNCTIONALITIES:-
1) I have added few shops and supplier , so by default on main page it will display supplier info and associated shops.
2) you can search for a specific shop using shop_name or any substring by navigating to the intendent url
3) you can check for how many shops are associated with a specific supplier.
